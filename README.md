# faultlines
Faultlines is a mapping project made with Census data, d3.js, and google streetviews.

Faultlines draws attention to differences between blockgroups by highlighting borders where differences are the most extreme.

The code here is for a prototype and still in the process of being developed, it is open to both rewriting and reuse.
